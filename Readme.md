How to run the code.

Run both files of .ipynb and .py in the files named folder on VS Code or any compiler.

1) Download the code and open the both files(situated in the folder named files) in a compiler and place it as they are in the folder by folder.
2) Run the cells of jupyter (.ipynb) file.
3) The dataset is placed in the folder next to files named audit_data.
4) Finally, run functions written in python file by using following code:

makingfunctions.c.read_file() ### Read file
makingfunctions.c.data_preprocessing() #### Data preprocessing
makingfunctions.c.plot_variables() #### Plot variables

Where, c is class object written in python (.py) file.
